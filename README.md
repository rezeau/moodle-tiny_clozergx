Moodle Tiny editor Clozergx question type button
=============================================

Cloned from the original "Moodle Tiny editor Cloze question type button" plugin by Stephan Robotta at https://github.com/srobotta/moodle-tiny_cloze

Works exactly like the original plugin, but adds a REGEXP question type to the interface. Needs the moodle-qtype_multianswerrgx to be installed. See https://github.com/rezeau/moodle-qtype_multianswerrgx
